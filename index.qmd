# Welcome!

I am currently a PhD Student at the Instiute of Forestry and Conservation at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Patrick M.A. James](http://www.jameslab.ca) and [Marie-Jos&#233;e Fortin](https://fortin.eeb.utoronto.ca/).

My research leverages large spatial and temporal datasets through remote sensing and other publicly available sources to understand the causes and consequences of spatial and temporal variation in wildfire burn severity. Head over to my [research](research.qmd) page to learn more.

## Recent News

New paper out in **Forests**! We show that for some species in Western North America, climate change was beneficial to growth patterns primarily at the northernmost extent of these species' ranges. However, these results also highlight the spatio-temporal complexity of growth response to recent glocal climate change. [Link](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/5/738#)
