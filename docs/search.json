    "text": "Overview\nMy research focuses on the cool-temperate ecosystems of the boreal forest of Canada. With climate warming these ecosystems are largely forgotten compared to western North America, and the ways that climate warming shapes natural disturbance dynamics in these ecosystems remain uncertain. I incorporate methods from different fields to answer my research questions, including remote sensing, spatial and temporal modelling, structural equation modelling and machine learning.\nMy on-going work covers three general themes:\n\nClimate drivers of wildfire severity\nInsect defoliator and wildfire interactions\nSnow cover dynamics and disturbance severity\n\n\nWhy do we care about wildfire burn severity?\nWildfire severity – changes in vegetation and soil following a wildfire – is an ecosystem's response to wildfire that has both ecological and societal impacts. Wildfire severity captures the change in ecosystem structure and function following a wildfire and directly affects ecosystem services such as succession, water quality, timber volume, soil fertility, climate regulation, food and water provision, and biodiversity. Fire and forest managers rely on knowledge about the drivers of wildfire severity to implement management strategies in targeted areas to reduce the costs associated with the loss of ecosystem services. Of particular concern to fire and forest managers are how the spatial and temporal legacies of environmental controls on wildfire will influence wildfire severity and, if so, will severity increase or decrease, and what spatial and temporal patterns in the environment are most important for wildfire severity.\n\n\nClimate drivers of wildfire severity\n\n\n\nStudy Area within the Western Boreal Shield of Ontario\n\n\nOver the last century, wildfires across the boreal forest have become larger and more intense. These trends are expected to continue under future climate projections, with longer fire seasons, more extreme droughts, and more frequent interactions with other disturbances. We know little about how climate change will impact wildfire severity in the eastern boreal forests of North America and what that will mean for resilience.\nOne of the challenges in forecasting burn severity under climate change is the temporal variabiliity inherent to climate and weather. Yet, how measurements of climate and weather at different time lags will influence models of fire behaviour is unclear. I am interested in the sensitivity of burn severity to moisture availability at different time-lags. Understanding at what time lag wildfire burn severity is most sensitive to changes in moisture availability will help build more accurate projections of wildfire severity under climate change and help managers conserve ecosystem services.\nI have shown that burn severity is most sensitive to moisture availability at short (intra-annual, monthly) time-lags in the managed forests of the Ontario boreal shield. At that winter and spring relative humidity is an important indicator for both median and extreme wildfire severity during the fire season.\n\n\n\nRelative influence explained by Short vs. long-term moisture\n\n\n\n\nSnow cover dynamics and wildfire severity\nClimate warming is projected to cause earlier snowmelt and reduction in snow cover duration. Since the boreal forest experiences a long snow-covered season and most of the annual precipitation falls as snow snow cover dynamics may play a prominent role in models of wildfire burn severity. Yet, no study has explicitly modelled the link between snow cover dynamics and wildfire burn severity. I am interested in the following:\n\nDoes the inclusion of snow cover dynamics improve models of wildfire burn severity?\nAre the effects of snow cover dynamics direct or indirect?\nDoes the relationship vary across spatial scales and throughout a fire season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Proposed causal relationships between snow phenology (blue), fire characteristics (red), forest characteristics (green) and climate (coral)"

    "text": "Research\n\n\n\nShort-term vs. Long-term trends in moisture availability\n\n\n\nStudy Area within the Western Boreal Shield of Ontario\n\n\nClimate warming is expected to increase wildfire intensity by creating conditions that are more conduhigh-severityseverity burning events. Rising temperatures across the boreal forest often coincide with reductions in both winter and summer precipitation that result in a water shortage. A growing concern is that a reduction in moisture availability at over short-time periods (i.e., monthly timescale) increases the availability and flammability of fuel and hence high probability of severe burning events. Yet across multiple years, the temporal cumulative water shortage deficit can limit tree growth and consequently fuel availability that ultimately decrease wildfire severity. Under climate change, how the variability in temporal moisture availability will affect wildfire intensity is uncertain. Here, we examine the variability on burn severity events in Ontario’s boreal forest according to near-term trends in moisture availability using remotely sensed burn data of burn severity (median and extreme) and climate data from 1986-2020. To compare the relative influence of two separate measures of antecedent moisture availability (Climate Moisture Index; CMI, Relative Humidity; RH) at monthly and yearly timescales on trends in burn severity, we use a stochastic gradient boosted regression tree approach. We found that short-term moisture dynamics have a greater influence on burn severity patterns, indicating that patterns of burn severity may be driven more by fuel moisture than fuel availability. Time-lags that represented moisture availability in the winter months were the most influential followed by spring related moisture availability, suggesting that changes to snow phenology and winter conditions may be important drivers of wildfire burn severity.\n\n\n\nRelative influence explained by Short vs. long-term moisture\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of snow cover on wildfire burn severity in the boreal forest"
